# üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
Prerequisites:
1. Android Studio installed on your system.
2. A smartphone running Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or above.
3. Basic understanding of Android development (optional).

## Steps
1. Clone this Repository
```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YOLOv10-TFLite-on-Android-for-Object-Detection.git
cd YOLOv10-TFLite-on-Android-for-Object-Detection
```
2. Make sure to run the colab file and export the YOLOv10-LiteRT model
3. Ensure the LiteRT model is placed in the [assets](https://github.com/atharvakulkarni-07/YOLOv10-TFLite-Android/tree/main/Android_App/app/src/main/assets) folder, which is a subfolder of Andriod application
4. Open the [app](https://github.com/atharvakulkarni-07/YOLOv10-TFLite-Android/tree/main/Android_App/app) folder in Android Studio
5. Launch Android Studio and open it as a new project.
6. Ensure the YOLOv10 TFLite model is in the assets folder
7. Build the App
8. Sync the project and build the APK.
9. Get the APK in your android device (via USB / other methods)
10. Install the APK and Run the App

# üì∏ How It Works
1. Open the app on your Android device.
2. Grant camera permissions if prompted.
3. Point your camera at an object.
4. The app will identify the object and display its label and bounding box in real time.
   
# üíª Technical Details
